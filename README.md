# Machine-Learning-course
This repository contains different activities about ML like algorithms, models, examples and topics related about this.

## Installation

In this repository are used different tools to build and create the whole scripts. You can do to install these using **pip3** (for *`Python 3.7.x`*)  Some of these tools are:
- Numpy: **pip3 install numpy**
- Pandas: **pip3 install pandas**
- Matplotlib: **pip3 install matplotlib**
- Jupyter: **pip3 install jupyter**
- IPython: **pip3 install ipython**

## Excercises

## Excercise 01: *Titanic survival exploration*
**Description**
- In this practice project, I start to create decision **functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger’s features**, such as sex and age. Starting with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until you are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data.

  For this assignment, we can find the [**titanic_survival_exploration**](https://github.com/JesusDiaz08/Machine-Learning-course/tree/master/Excercises/01%20titanic_survival_exploration). folder containing the necessary project files on the Machine Learning projects GitHub.

  This project contains three main files:
  - **titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb**: This is the main file where you will be performing your work on the project using `Jupyter Notebook`.
  - **titanic_data.csv**: The project dataset. We’ll load this data in the notebook `Jupyter Notebook`.
  - **visuals.py**: This `Python` script provides supplementary visualizations for the project. ***Do not modify.***
